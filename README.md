# Hospital Patient Management System

This project stores and analyzes hospital patient records in a shared text file (`hospital.txt`).
Each C file implements a specific operation on the same 24-record dataset.

## Project Structure

```

├── hosp_age.c        # Oldest and youngest patient finder
├── hosp_condn.c      # Critical condition filter

## Patient Record Format

All modules use the same structure:

- `name` (string, no spaces)
- `age` (integer)
- `address` (string, no spaces)
- `condition` (string, no spaces)
- `ward` / `ward_name` (string, no spaces)

Data is read/written in this text format:

```text
Name Age Address Condition Ward
```

## Implemented Functions (Excluding `main.c` Functionality)

### `hosp_place.c`

- `displayKathmanduPatients()`
Prompts for a city name, scans `hospital.txt`, prints matching patients, and prints total matched count.

### `hosp_age.c`

- `hospitalage()`
Reads all 24 records, finds maximum and minimum age, and prints oldest and youngest patient names (including ties).

### `hosp_condn.c`

- `hospitalcondition()`
Reads records and prints only patients whose `condition` is exactly `Critical` in a formatted table.

### `hosp_count.c`

- `hospitalPatientCount()`
Reads records and prints total patient counts for these wards:
`GynoWard`, `OrthoWard`, `CardioWard`, `NeuroWard`, `PediatricWard`, `EmergencyWard`, `ICUWard`, `SurgicalWard`, `GeneralWard`, `MaternityWard`.

### `hosp_read.c`

This file currently contains the same core utility functions in one place:

- `displayKathmanduPatients()`
- `hospitalage()`
- `hospitalcondition()`
- `hospitalPatientCount()`

### `hosp_write.c`

This module handles data entry and writes 24 records into `hospital.txt`.

---

## Build and Run

Compile any module you want to run:

```bash
gcc hosp_write.c -o hosp_write
gcc hosp_place.c -o hosp_place
gcc hosp_age.c -o hosp_age
gcc hosp_condn.c -o hosp_condn
gcc hosp_count.c -o hosp_count
gcc hosp_read.c -o hosp_read
```

Run (examples):

```bash
./hosp_write
./hosp_place
./hosp_age
./hosp_condn
./hosp_count
./hosp_read
```

On Windows:

```bash
hosp_write.exe
hosp_place.exe
hosp_age.exe
hosp_condn.exe
hosp_count.exe
hosp_read.exe
```

---

## Important Notes

- Run `hosp_write` first to create/update `hospital.txt`.
- Most modules assume exactly 24 records.
- Input format is space-separated (`scanf("%s", ...)`), so multi-word names/addresses/conditions are not supported.
- Some filters are exact/case-sensitive (for example, `Critical` in condition check).
